            increasing risk of retinal cell death</a>. Blue light that has high energy and a short wavelength, and due to the 
            photoelectric effect, it can remove more electrons off of molecules and damage the eye by changing its oxygen concentrations ().
        In addition to eye-strain, studies have shown that light-emitting electronics before bedtime can have a signficant

         impact on sleep, morning alertness, melatonin suppression, and the circadian clock</a>. A shifted circadian clock would be like having
         jet-lag: the body feels like it is not aligned with our daily schedules. Ultimately, this would decrease the amount of sleep

            From the scientific journals that I have  <a class = "clickableText" href = "#third">
               researched</a>,  most of them demonstrate that these negative effects are 
         not as visible and harmful in short-term studies (6 months to 1.5 years). For most of these, however, a longitudinal study does not exist.
         In a world where technology has perpetuated every aspect of our life, the long-term consequences of blue-light should be studied. 
         We don't know how constant blue-light and shifts in our circadian rhythm will effect aging, eye-sight, and stress. 
         One could say that we could compare the eye-tissue and health of people who heavily use screen electronics with those who have not,
      but there are so many confounding factors such as age, natural sunlight, genetics.  </div>
