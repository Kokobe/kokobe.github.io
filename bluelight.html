            photoelectric effect, it can remove more electrons off of molecules and damage the eye by changing its oxygen concentrations ().

         impact on sleep, morning alertness, melatonin suppression, and the circadian clock</a>. A shifted circadian clock would be like having
         jet-lag: the body feels like it is not aligned with our daily schedules. Ultimately, this would decrease the amount of sleep

            From the scientific journals that I have  <a class = "clickableText" href = "#third">
               researched</a>,  most of them demonstrate that these negative effects are 
         not as visible and harmful in short-term studies (6 months to 1.5 years). For most of these, however, a longitudinal study does not exist.
         In a world where technology has perpetuated every aspect of our life, the long-term consequences of blue-light should be studied. 
         We don't know how constant blue-light and shifts in our circadian rhythm will effect aging, eye-sight, and stress. 
         One could say that we could compare the eye-tissue and health of people who heavily use screen electronics with those who have not,
      but there are so many confounding factors such as age, natural sunlight, genetics.  </div>

   <div class = "left-text"> Flip the switch above. See how the background shifts into warmer tones?  
      Night-shift mode is essentially a mode where blue-light is minimized on your device screen. Apple and Android products all have
      this function, but does it actually work?

               One study</a> performs a matched-pairs comparing usages of Night-shift mode. They found out that blue-light (no Night-Shift) does encourage 
         melatonin suppression, but melatonin suppression did not significantly differ between the mode being on/off. However, the long-term
         benefits of using Night-Shift mode still need to be researched.  </div>

                  Studies on other methods of blocking blue-light emission</a> 
                  also offer some insight: orange-tinted glasses significantly reduces short wavelength emissions (blue and purple light). 
                  Color adjustment apps (performing like Night-Shift mode) are also very effective in reducing these short-wave emissions.
