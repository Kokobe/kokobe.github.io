    Since Essential  <a class = "clickableText" href= "https://www.essential.com/blog/essential-update">discontinued</a>,
    I was allowed to share one of the 3 projects I built on the Summer of 2019: Walkie Talkie.
    I'm extremely sad that Essential's Project GEM will not be coming to the market because 
    this Android application was going to be an Easter Egg for the future phone; it also acted as a prototype for 
    the company-wide <a class = "clickableText" href= "https://videos.ctfassets.net/6nksu8gsclwp/7kut0mQHcGQP1T90mBhMHr/8f080be34f700e874ef89ae2e8fccef7/3o4GEM-VoiceFinalA.mp4">Voice Mode</a> feature. 

   
       Walkie Talkie was made for the dimensions of Project GEM (shown above) and 
       it does exactly what it's name says: it streams voice input to other users.  

       <br> <br> <br>
       THE BASICS: I designed an Android app that dynamically translates sound waves into chunks of bytes
       while also sending these bytes at a certain rate across a socket server. 
       (This required multithreading.) I created a voice input/output socket server hosted on AWS to
       stream to all users in the same "squad". Pressing the Walkie Talkie button can also 
       send push notifications to a friend that isn't currently on the app. 

       <br> <br> <br>
       With the guidance of the Android and server-side experts at Essential, I built a scalable server and application 
       that dynamically stores user data into Firebase Realtime Database. 
       The app enables user customization, as one can edit their username, save friends/groups, 
        and even map their fingerprints to friends; moreover, I integrated the fingerprint sensor as a way
        to choose users to stream to.

        Here are some of the tools I used:
